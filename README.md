A Client/Server based classroom response system is a tool that allows an instructor to send a question to all participant students and to collect their answers.  The system is composed of multiple CRS clients (for students and the instructor) and aCRS server. The CRS client recognizes two types of users: instructor and student. The systems allows both types of uses to register and login. Additionally, the instructor can send a question to all online students. The system collects all the responses and shows the results to the instructor. Online students receive all the questions submitted by the instructor and can submit their answers. The CRS client program also displays the list of online/offline users in the system (and their types). The CRS server manages the users and forwards messages to online users.
